## ðŸ“„ Abstract

> Humans only recognize a few items in a scene at once and memorize three to seven items in the short term. Such limitations can be mitigated using cognitive offloading (e.g., sticky notes, digital reminders). We studied whether a gaze-enabled Augmented Reality (AR) system could facilitate cognitive offloading and improve object retrieval performance. To this end, we developed NeighboAR, which detects objects in a userâ€™s surroundings and generates a graph that stores object proximity relationships and userâ€™s gaze dwell times for each object. In a controlled experiment, we asked N=17 participants to inspect randomly distributed objects and later recall the position of a given target object. Our results show that displaying the target together with the proximity object with the longest user gaze dwell time helps recalling the position of the target. Specifically, NeighboAR significantly reduces the retrieval time by 33%, number of errors by 71%, and perceived workload by 10%.
